# RFC: Saber v1

__Note: this is a proposal, feedback welcome__

## `pages` folder

Saber uses file-system based routing, which means it automatically loads `pages/**/*.{vue,js,jsx,ts,tsx,md}` as app routes. Routes are Vue components, non-components like Markdown files are converted to Vue components internally, e.g. for `about.md`:

```markdown
__Let me caculate 1 + 1 for you {{ 1 + 1 }}__
```

it converts to something like (simplified):

```vue
<template>
  <strong>Let me caculate 1 + 1 for you {{ 1 + 1 }}</strong>
</template>
```

### Page Config

Addtional information about this page, in `index.vue`, for example:

```vue
<template>
  <div>Home</div>
</template>

<script>
export const config = {
  title: 'HomePage',
  layout: 'default'
}
</script>
```

#### Pagination

Use the config option `pagination`:

```vue
<script>
export const config = {
  pagination: {
    byProp: 'drafts',
    perPage: 30
  }
}
</script>
```

If this page maps to `/`, then Saber will create `/page/:page`. See below for where the prop `drafts` comes from.

## `functions` folder

__Functions__ are used to fetch data that you can consume in pages, let's say you have a `posts.js` inside `functions` folder:

```js
export default async ({ type }) => {
  const posts = await getAllPostsFromApi()
  return posts.filter(post => post.type === type)
}
```

Then a function called `posts` will be available and you can use it like this in a page:

```vue
<script>
export const config = {
  injectProps: {
    drafts: {
      function: 'posts',
      options: {
        type: 'draft'
      }
    }
  }
}

export default {
  props: ['drafts']
}
</script>
```

By using `injectProps` here Saber will call the function at build time and store the result as JSON file.

### HTTP Functions

A function that could be requested via `fetch` or `xhr` at runtime, it should export a HTTP request handler and be populated inside `functions/http` folder:

```js
// functions/http/atom.xml.js

import posts from '../posts'

export default (req, res) => {
  const posts = await posts({ type: 'public' })
  const xml = generateXMLFeed(posts)
  res.end(xml)
}
```

HTTP functions use file-system base routing as well, the above exampile will be mapped to `/atom.xml`.

## Themes

No changes compared to current version (so far).

## Build Targets

### `static`

Everything is prerendered at build time, in this target you can't access dynamic properties like `req.query` in HTTP functions.

### `server` 

[UNFINISHED]

We prerender every page, but serving HTTP functions at corresponding paths, so you have full access to all properties under `req`.
